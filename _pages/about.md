I am a Machine Learning Programmer/Artificial Intelligence Specialist at [Aerial](https://www.aerial.ai/) with a variety of interests: neuroscience, engineering, music, digital signal processing, artificial intelligence, and their combinations. I currently work developping AI-powered products for the healthcare industry. My main goal in life is to use engineering and AI solutions to translate research into real world applications, specially in the field of neuroscience.

Here you will find all the projects I've been working on for the past few years. These projects range from the research I've done during my schooling, to some of the art performances I've led and participated in. Feel free to email me your questions or project proposals, I will probably respond in this way:
